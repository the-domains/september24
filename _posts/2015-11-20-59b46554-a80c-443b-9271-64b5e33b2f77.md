Like most people we think The Godfather is great and if asked to rate it on a five star scale would say that it's a five star movie. 
When asked to consider Sleepless in Seattle we might also rate it as five stars.
Are they the same movie? 
They're both five stars.
They're both filmed in color.
They're both over 90 minutes long.
